https://www.academind.com/learn/javascript/rxjs-6-what-changed/


# Observable, Subject etc.

import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable'
import { Subject } from 'rxjs/Subject'
becomes
import { Observable, Subject } from 'rxjs'


# Operators
import 'rxjs/add/operator/map'
import 'rxjs/add/operator/take'
becomes
import { map, take } from 'rxjs/operators'


# Methods to Create Observables
import 'rxjs/add/observable/of'
// or
import { of } from 'rxjs/observable/of'
becomes
import { of } from 'rxjs'

---------------------------

The following operators were renamed
catch()   => catchError()
do() 	  => tap()
finally() => finalize()
switch()  => switchAll()

Additionally, some Observable-creation methods were renamed/ refactored:

throw()   => throwError()
fromPromise() => from() (this automatically detects the type)
